ABOUT THE MODULE
----------------

This gives you the ability to let JavaScript create the scrollbars of a div of
whatever element you need which actually gives you more control over stuff like
styles, callbacks, etc.

INSTALLATION
------------

See http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes.

PERMISSIONS
-----------

The module adds an 'Administer jScrollPane' permission that is required to view
the jScrollPane settings form.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

An admin settings form is located at /admin/config/jscrollpane.


USAGE
-----

With the module enabled, the javascript and CSS files are automatically added
when a page is loaded. By default, the jScollPane class is .scroll-pane. Any
elements with this class will automatically get the jScrollPane scrollbar
applied to it. If you wish to use a different class then it can be changed on
the admin settings page.
